# Jedis #

Jedis is a blazingly small and sane redis java client.

Jedis was conceived to be EASY to use.

Jedis is fully compatible with the redis master branch.

## Why Jedis is a Release Candidate? ##
Because I want to add Sharding and add more documentation to the site. And also publish the benchmark results, which are pretty good (around 26 Kops for GETs and SETs, and 126 Kops for GETs and SETs in pipeling mode).

## What will be available soon? ##
  * harding
  * ore and more code and performance improvements

But stay close because things are going fast and all this will be implemented soon!

## Ok.. so what can I do with Jedis? ##
All of the following reids features are supported:

  * Sorting
  * Connection handling
  * Commands operating on all the kind of values
  * Commands operating on string values
  * Commands operating on hashes
  * Commands operating on lists
  * Commands operating on sets
  * Commands operating on sorted sets
  * Transactions
  * Pipelining
  * Publish/Subscribe
  * Persistence control commands
  * Remote server control commands
  * Connection pooling

## How do I use it? ##

You can download the latests build at:
> http://github.com/xetorthio/jedis/downloads

To use it just:
```
    Jedis jedis = new Jedis("localhost");
    jedis.connect();
    jedis.set("foo", "bar");
    String value = jedis.get("foo");
```
For more usage examples check the tests. Soon I will add a nice wiki with everything you should know.

And you are done!
